                    <p>I went to Vancouver Film School for Game Design back in 2012. While at VFS, I fell into the role of being an artist. I had taken 3D modeling classes a long time ago in High School, but I never thought of myself as an artist. After graduating from VFS I ended up working in Quality Assurance at EA. I remember telling myself that I would only be there for a year before I moved up or moved out. 4 years later, after trying to create games on my own outside of work (and never finishing anything) as well as doing a couple of art contracts, I needed to get out of being just QA at EA. It was a difficult choice to leave as I had the pleasure of working with the most amazing people ever (including my partner Kyle) but I wasn’t fulfilled at all working as just QA. So with the support of my amazing girlfriend Tashia, I was able to quit my job to begin making Batter Up VR.</p>

                    <p>In the early 2000’s I got my first PC with a dial-up modem and immediately found myself in the world of game cracking. It was love at first sight with computers, and I went to school to see what avenue I wanted to try. Coding instantly grabbed me and I’ve been enamored with it ever since. I have a passion for building things, I’m pretty much always working on something on the side. Typically it’s been web apps, but I’ve created an iOS/Android game using Corona SDK, which was an interesting experience (pro-tip: just find/hire someone to do frontend/graphics unless you REALLY like it). I’ve mostly worked in web development, but always wanted to get into games a little more, so happily enough during my tenure at EA I met Trevor who knew a lot about building games with Unity. We decided to start working together, with him running the front and myself running the back.. it’s been love ever since ❤</p>

                        <p>Explore the woods, survive the night. 

                        Arriving late to the abandoned Oakwood campground, you find the violent remains of your friends' campsite. Exploring the forest and the dilapidated lodge, you discover that prehistoric predators now hunt the grounds. You’ll run breathlessly through raptor infested forests, get lost in dark corridors, and hold your breath to avoid the most fearsome dinosaur of all in this First-Person horror adventure.

                        Oakwood is a single-player flight for survival that invites players to explore the dark depths and ominous history of the abandoned campground. You will find yourself clutching your flashlight, traversing through the area on a search for your missing friends. As you explore, you will uncover clues about the violent events that unfolded the night before. Realizing the dangers surrounding the campground, you will need to dash through forests, hide in dark corridors, and outsmart the prehistoric creatures who are hunting ruthlessly throughout the grounds.</p>
