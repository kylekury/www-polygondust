                    <p>Spending many nights falling asleep with a controller in hands or my head hitting the keyboard playing games, I never even considered that I could work in the games industry or even create my own games. In 2012 I took the Game Design program at Vancouver Film School. It was an amazing experience with tons of learning, and connections made that allowed me to get into the industry. My first job after VFS was Quality Assurance at EA. After 4 years of working with some incredible and talented people, I was struggling with working on games outside of work. I met Kyle at EA and we had been trying to work on games together for awhile but nothing got past protoype phases. I ended up quitting and taking 1 year off so we could release our first game, Batter Up VR. After release, I ended up working as a Software Engineer at a game studio in Vancouver for a couple years until I landed my current job as a Game Designer at Over The Moons Games.</p>
                    <ul><b>Favourite Games:</b> Breath of the Wild, World of Warcraft, Dark Souls, Windwaker, Mario Kart, Ultimate Chicken Horse</ul>
                    <ul><b>Favourite Movies:</b> Indie Game: The Movie (Steam says I have 45 hours played, I’ve watched it a lot…), Tron: Legacy, Toy Story, The Big Lebowski.</ul>
                    <ul><b>Favourite TV Shows:</b> Seinfeld, The Office, Parks and Rec, Steins; Gate, Sword Art Online (only season 1)</ul>

                    <p>In the early 2000’s I got my first PC with a dial-up modem and immediately found myself in the world of game cracking. It was love at first sight with computers, and I went to school to see what avenue I wanted to try. Coding instantly grabbed me and I’ve been enamored with it ever since. I have a passion for building things, I’m pretty much always working on something on the side. Typically it’s been web apps, but I’ve created an iOS/Android game using Corona SDK, which was an interesting experience (pro-tip: just find/hire someone to do frontend/graphics unless you REALLY like it). I’ve mostly worked in web development, but always wanted to get into games a little more, so happily enough during my tenure at EA I met Trevor who knew a lot about building games with Unity. We decided to start working together, with him running the front and myself running the back.. it’s been love ever since ❤</p>

                    <p>Use your driving, jumping, and jousting skills to knock out rival breakfast foods in this wild party game for up to 4. Grab one of six characters and get ready to get Toasted!</p><br>

                    <ul><b>SIX CHARACTERS, SO MANY HATS</b><br>Choose your warrior, from the not-so-sweet Nigiri to the gruff Business Toast. Find a hat that truly speaks to you (and try not to lose it in the rush of battle). Pick a paint job that makes your heart sing.</ul>
                    <ul><b>ARENAS</b><br>Ranging from a peaceful stony outcropping to a deadly lava lair, pick an arena that will challenge you and your friends.</ul>
                    <ul><b>TEAM UP</b><br>Play against some rather friendly or vicious AI; great for blowing off steam or getting some practice in.</ul>

                    <p>Explore the woods, survive the night. 
                    Arriving late to the abandoned Oakwood campground, you find the violent remains of your friends' campsite. Exploring the forest and the dilapidated lodge, you discover that prehistoric predators now hunt the grounds. You’ll run breathlessly through raptor infested forests, get lost in dark corridors, and hold your breath to avoid the most fearsome dinosaur of all in this First-Person horror adventure.
                    Oakwood is a single-player flight for survival that invites players to explore the dark depths and ominous history of the abandoned campground. You will find yourself clutching your flashlight, traversing through the area on a search for your missing friends. As you explore, you will uncover clues about the violent events that unfolded the night before. Realizing the dangers surrounding the campground, you will need to dash through forests, hide in dark corridors, and outsmart the prehistoric creatures who are hunting ruthlessly throughout the grounds.</p>
